# Delphic Digital Base Pattern Library

_Not official (yet) - this is just an experiment for now._
This here is a styleguide that can serve as the base for future projects, hence the project-agnostic styles. Started from the [gulp version](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp) of [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/). I'd recommend reading their [docs](http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html) before adding anything to this, it'll make it all make more sense!

### Commands
Set up and run a local copy of the project:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Utility libraries

Go through and pick out, here's a good resource (note there are competitors included within this, we'll need to make a decision on which to use)

### Updating / modernizing 

Submit pull requests with the compnent / utility to be updated & a small analysis of the differences between the old thing and the new thing you're pitching. Team lunch chat to kick it off / in depth chat in the pr.
